Install Lein
============
* Download the lein script from https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
* Place it on your $PATH (eg. ~/bin)
* Set it to be executable. (chmod a+x ~/bin/lein)
* lein is basically a wrapper/bootstrap shell script. When ever you execute
  it, it downloads necessary jar dependencies automatically.

Install Cloure
==============
* Do not install clojure distributed via apt or yum repositories. Lein takes
  care of it automatically.
* If you run "lein repl", it will download clojure and dependent jar files to
  ~/.lein and throw a clojure REPL prompt.
  $ lein repl
  => (clojure-version)
* If you run "lein repl", from within the pumkin source repository, you will
  get a clojure REPL specific to pumkin'sminimum requirements.

  $ cd git/pumkin
  $ lein repl
  => (clojure-version)
