Lein getting started:
* https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/TUTORIAL.md
* http://alexott.net/en/clojure/ClojureLein.html

Install Lein
* Download the lein script from https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
* Place it on your $PATH (eg. ~/bin)
* Set it to be executable. (chmod a+x ~/bin/lein)
* lein is basically a wrapper/bootstrap shell script. When ever you execute it, it downloads necessary jar dependencies automatically.

Installing Cloure
* Even though apt or yum repositories distribute Clojure, do not install them. Lein takes care of it automatically.
* If you run "lein repl", it will download clojure and dependent jar files to ~/.lein and throw a clojure REPL prompt.
$ lein repl
=> (clojure-version)
* If you run "lein repl", from within the source repository, you will get a clojure REPL specific to "pumkin" minimum requirements.
$ cd git/pumkin
$ lein repl
=> (clojure-version)

Configure GNU Emacs to use lein REPL via nrepl 
Use nrepl emacs package to connect to lien's REPL server.

Add the following lines to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el (or deprecated ~/.emacs).  
Note 1: If you are still using .emacs, I would recommend "mv ~/.emacs ~/.emacs.d/init.el". Then add the following to init.el. If not emacs will ignore init.el and continue to load .emacs.
Note 2: Also check to see if you have older package.el related configuration in your init.el. It may conflict with this new configuration. It may be ok to delete them.

Note: It make take some time if you are running for the first time. Lein will download dependencies.

Pull pumkin source
* git clone git@github.com:Pumkin/pumkin.git
* cd pumkin
